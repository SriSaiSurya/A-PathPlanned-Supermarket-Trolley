Autonomous Navigation through Simulation:

Implemented and analysed C++ language.
Generated and simulated maps for developing path planning and control algorithms.
Mobile robot kinematics and sensors in a 2D environment.
Created terrain/environment with dynamic obstacles, designed occupancy grids from different sources using various robot sensors. Used Lidar scanning with SLAM Map Builder app.
